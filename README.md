# Project 2 Proposal

## Ensights (Energy Insights)
A data-driven application dedicated to helping users recognize the value of making energy-smart purchases. The site includes user authentication, search and browse for energy-efficient products, data-visualization, an energy-savings calculator, and links to purchase products and user reviews. 

## Technology Used 
User Authentication, Energy Star API, Amazon API, Energy Savings Calculator, and possibly other APIs as we build out the application.

## Challenges 
Lots of data sets and pages on the site. Data storage options? Cost savings calculator maybe tricky. 

## Contingencies
Minimize data sets by honing in on only specific appliances.

## Deficiencies 
Amazon API will not return all appliances
