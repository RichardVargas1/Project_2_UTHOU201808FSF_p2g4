# Project 2 Proposal

## Hello Stranger
A real-time video matching application. 

First Impressions are everything! Think Omegle meets Tinder. Users will sign up for an account, choose their orientation, and have 5 seconds to match with a total "nearby" stranger. If they match, they can continue the conversation. If not, they're gone forever. This app is focused on anonymity and the need to know who swiped the other way. 

## Technology Used 
Twilio Programmable Video, Google Maps API, Random User Generator API

## Challenges 
Getting the Twilio camera to allow for multiple users. Entering video conference anonymously, going through a 5 second impression of another user, and allowing them to choose who they want to match with based off input. 

## Contingencies
If the Twilio camera does not work the way we intended or programming requirements exceed our bandwidth, we may opt to use a carousel of MP4's as a demonstration/mockup for future developement.
